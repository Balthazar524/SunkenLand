Sunken Land Game Content

I am new to the game playing with a couple of friends, but haven't found much content of where to find things, crafting recipes, and much more other things. I hope this will help others out as well. If I miss anything out feel free to comment and correct me or help me out as well as others. As we all know SunkenLand is still in Early Access. So, be patient while I make on-going changes to this Forum. 

I didn't get paid to do this and I'm not affliatated with the company.
